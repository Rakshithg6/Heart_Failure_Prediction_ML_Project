# Heart_Failure_Prediction_ML_Project

This repository contains code for predicting heart failure using machine learning techniques. Heart failure is a critical medical condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to various health complications. Early prediction of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the dataset from the Kaggle. It consists of 12 clinical features and a target variable indicating whether the patient died or not due to heart failure.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter notebook (for running the notebooks)

You can install the dependencies using pip:
